Hi [HIRING MANAGER/RECRUITER NAME],

I recently came across the [POSITION] role at [COMPANY] and wanted to reach out directly. With my background in [RELEVANT EXPERIENCE] and hands-on experience with [KEY SKILLS], I believe I could be a strong fit for your team.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my experience with [SPECIFIC PROJECT/SKILL] could contribute to [COMPANY]'s goals.

Would you be open to a brief conversation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]
